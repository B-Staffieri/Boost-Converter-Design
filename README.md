# Boost-Converter-Design
Switching power supply (SPS) that generates 12.5V and is able to supply well beyond 20 mA using the Boost topology. Input to the chip is a DC voltage that can vary from 4 to 5.25V. Design is a chip to be used on a printed circuit board, layout indicates where to connect bond pads. MOSFET driving the inductor in the chip is properly sized (treated as a non-ideal component).
